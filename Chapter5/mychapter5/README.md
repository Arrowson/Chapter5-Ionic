### Overview of app

This app makes use of Wilken's code along with Babb's code to create views 
and controllers that create and display data dealing with conversion rates from
Bitcoin. It includes many currencies along with a detailed history of each available
currency.
#### Issues with the application
```.factory("indexDBService", function($window, $q) {```
I honestly don't have a good grasp on indexxedDB forsome reason. I copied the code practically
word for word from Babb's code on GitHub.
